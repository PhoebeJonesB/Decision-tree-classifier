Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

The dataset used for the task is the boston_dataset: Boston house prices dataset

The goal is to use decision tree and compare with ensemble models to be able to predict the prices of houses based on the data.
